This is a simple Weather App built using Tkinter (Python's GUI library) and OpenWeatherMap API.

**Requirements:**
Python 3, Tkinter (pre-installed with Python), Requests library (install using pip install requests)

Here are the steps to get your OpenWeatherMap API key:  
1. Go to OpenWeatherMap - Visit [OpenWeatherMap](https://home.openweathermap.org/).  
2. Sign Up or Log In
   - If you donâ€™t have an account, click "Sign Up" and create one.  
   - If you already have an account, log in.  
3. Get API Key 
   - After logging in, go to the "API keys" section in your profile.  
   - A default API key is generated automatically, or you can create a new one by clicking "Create Key" and giving it a name.  
4. Activate & Use
   - API keys might take some time to activate (usually within a few hours).  
   - Use the key in your script by replacing `API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"`.
